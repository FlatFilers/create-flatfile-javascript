## Guide

Create a new Space each time Flatfile is opened. This suits situations where a clean slate for every interaction is preferred and is the simplest initial setup for learning.

1. To get started, set your `publishableKey`` in public/index.html.
2. Then, run `npm start` in your terminal`
3. Head to your localhost url output in the terminal and click the Flatfile button. You'll see a new Space get created. It contains a Workbook and a simple data hook validation.
4. Upload a file (find getting-started.csv in root) or manually enter some data.
